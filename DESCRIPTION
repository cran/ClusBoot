Description: Clustering algorithms are designed to cluster objects into a number of clusters. Any clustering algorithm provides the 'best'
             grouping of objects according to some criterion.
             This does not guarantee a 'good' clustering solution in the sense that some allocations were not simply the result of chance.
             This package allows the user to apply any clustering algorithm to a data set. The cluster allocations are subjected to a 
             bootstrap analysis 
             to determine the extent to which the clustering structure is stable and fundamental to the data set. For more information
