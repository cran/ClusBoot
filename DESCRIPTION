Description: Providing a cluster allocation for n samples, either with an $n \times p$ data matrix or an $n \times n$ distance
                matrix, a bootstrap procedure is performed. The proportion of bootstrap replicates where a pair of samples
                cluster in the same cluster indicates who tightly the samples in a particular cluster clusters together.
